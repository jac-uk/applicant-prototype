        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l"> Overview of the role </h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">The First-tier Tribunal Chambers are:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>Immigration and Asylum</li>
          <li>Social Entitlement</li>
          <li>War Pensions and Armed Forces Compensation</li>
          <li>Health, Education and Social Care</li>
          <li>Property</li>
          <li>Tax</li>
          <li>General Regulatory</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Tribunals often sit as panels consisting of a legally qualified chair (the judge) and non-legal members
          with specific areas of expertise, though certain types of cases or appeals can be presided over by a judge
          sitting alone. Except in cases that involve national security or evidence of a very personal nature,
          substantive final hearings in tribunal cases are held in public.
        </P>
        <p>During the hearing the judge must ensure that the overriding objective (to deal with cases fairly and
          justly) is observed, which will include all parties having the opportunity to participate in proceedings as
          fully and fairly as possible. Many cases involve individuals putting their own case forward without legal
          assistance. The judge should therefore help ensure the system is accessible to all by guiding parties
          through the procedures appropriately. </P>

        <p>During the case, the judge and non-legal members can ask questions on any point that needs clarification or
          which will assist the tribunal in reaching a decision. The judge also decides on all matters of procedure
          that may arise during a hearing. </P>
