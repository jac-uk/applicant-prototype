            take and when you’ll need to take them. </p>

          <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">1. Situational judgement test</h3>

          <p class="govuk-body">You’ll have a set time to answer a number of multiple-choice questions. Each question

          <p class="govuk-body">There are 5 possible answers for each question. You’ll need to choose which you think
            are the best and worst answer in each case. There are no marks for next best or next worst answer.</p>

          <p class="govuk-body">Tests are scored automatically. You’ll need to answer at least 30% of questions
            correctly.</p>
          </p>

          <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">2. Critical analysis test</h3>

          <p class="govuk-body">We’ll send you a legal judgment or text before the test date. During the test, you’ll
            have a set time to answer a number of multiple-choice questions about this text.
            Each questions will have a choice of 5 answers. You’ll have to decide which is the most accurate.</p>

            There are also different maximum scores for each question. Again, these will be clearly marked.</p>

          <p class="govuk-body">Answers are marked by JAC panellists. These are validated to make sure marking is
            consistent across all panellists. </p>

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Test dates</h2>
          <p class="govuk-body">We try to avoid holding qualifying tests during school and judicial holiday dates. It’s

          <p class="govuk-body">If exceptional circumstances mean you cannot take a test on the specified date, we’ll
            arrange a second test date. </p>
