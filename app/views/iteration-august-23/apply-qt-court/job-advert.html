                    <p>The Lord Chancellor expects that candidates for salaried posts will have sufficient directly
                      relevant previous judicial experience. Only in exceptional cases and if the candidate in
                      question has demonstrated the necessary skills in some other significant way should an exception
                      be made.</p>

                    <p>The meaning of “directly relevant experience” is sitting as a judge in a salaried or fee-paid
                      capacity. For fee-paid judges this should be for a period of at least two years or 30 sitting
                      days since appointment.</P>

                      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">
                        <p>Tribunal administration is located in Llandrindod Wells. Tribunal hearings are conducted
                          across all regions of Wales, candidates must be available to hear cases and travel
                          independently throughout Wales and be able to stay overnight where necessary.</P>


                        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">
                          Jurisdiction

                            <p>Successful candidates will be deployed to sit in either family or civil jurisdictions
                              across all circuits. You will be required, on your application, to indicate and rank
                              your location preferences. However, this information will play no part in selection
                              decisions and will be used for deployment purposes only. </p>

                            <p>Some District Judges are also nominated to sit as judges of the Court of Protection
                              either in London or in the regions. There may be a requirement of 1 post specifically
                              from this recruitment exercise for full-time secondment to the Court of Protection in
                              London. </p>

                            <p>Final deployment decisions will be a matter for the Senior Presiding Judge. It may not
                              always be possible to deploy successful candidates in line with their preferences,
                              depending on business need. You may, therefore, be deployed to any of the regions. In
                              circumstances where the preferences of candidates do not match vacancy requirements, the
                              Senior Presiding Judge may take account of the order of merit to give those who are most
                              meritorious priority of assignment to their preferred circuit. </p>
